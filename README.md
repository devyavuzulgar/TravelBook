# TravelBook

In the second month of my Swift training, we made a simple travel book with Mapkit and Coredata in which I could record the places I visited. In this application, I learned how to save and delete data in Coredata. With Mapkit, I learned how to get a location from the user and display this location on a map.

I would like to thank Atıl Smancıoğlu for what I learned in this training.

Note: I didn't focus too much on the UI part, my goal was to learn Mapkit and Coredata.
